# BSides Orlando

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **Security BSides Orlando** — Central Florida's community-driven information security conference.

## What is a Security BSides?

[Security BSides](https://www.securitybsides.com/) events are community-organized conferences that create opportunities for people to share ideas and have in-depth discussions about security topics. BSides events are typically free or low-cost, volunteer-run, and focused on building local security communities.

BSides Orlando brings together security professionals, students, hobbyists, and anyone curious about information security for a day of talks, workshops, networking, and learning.
